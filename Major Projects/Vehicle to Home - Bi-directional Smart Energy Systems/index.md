## üåü Project Overview

The [BeagleBone-V2H](https://github.com/rand12345/BeagleBone-V2H) project focused on the reverse engineering and experimentation of an [Indra Vehicle to Grid (V2G)](https://www.indra.co.uk/v2g/) bi-directional charging system. The aim was to replicate the functionality of the existing system with local control only. This involved building a completely new BeagleBone firmware image, writing custom kernel overlays for hardware support, and developing a bespoke application in Rust. Additionally, a [SvelteKit](https://github.com/rand12345/v2h_webui) webUI was prototyped to provide local user control through a websockets interface. Upon completing a proof of concept, a load matching [Vehicle to Home (V2H)](https://www.indra.co.uk/v2h/) feature was added so that the connected electric vehicle could safely power an entire home and charge from excess solar automatically.

### üîë Stages

||| **üîß Reverse Engineering Commercial CHAdeMO V2G System:**

- [Dumped eMMC image](https://github.com/rand12345/Ardni-V2H) of existing firmware, extracted configs, and decompiled main executable
- [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org) for reverse engineering existing C++ CHAdeMO V2G firmware
- Extracted boot and runtime logs through TTL UART
|||  
||| **üõ† Implementing Peripherals and Drivers:**

- Retained access to hardware components using bespoke Linux kernel overlays
- Designed custom libraries for EV DC rapid charging [CHAdeMO CAN](https://crates.io/crates/chademo-rs), [PRE 6kW bi-directional CAN charger](https://www.chademo.com/wp2016/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/V2G%206kW%20-%2010kW%20datasheet.pdf), [STMicro STPM3x SPI energy monitor](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stpm32.pdf), [Analog Devices AD7237 SPI ADC](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad7237.html), and [Philips PCA95xx I2C GPIO extender](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ee00013/microPCI/files/I2C/Philips%20Semiconductors%20I2C%20Handbook.pdf)
|||
|||- **üí° Designing Replacement Application:**

- Developed a ground-up replacement application in Rust with the aim of cloud disconnection and local control only.

||| **üî¨ Experimenting with CCS Adaption:**

- Conducted experiments on adapting the CHAdeMO interface using [pyPLC](https://github.com/uhi22/pyPLC) to enable CCS for EV charging using GreenPHY for protocol communication.
|||
